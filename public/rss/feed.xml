            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#x27;re reading this, I&#x27;m probably already dead ‚ò†Ô∏è</p>
<p>Just Kidding! While I may be sick in a foreign country nearly at the opposite point of the globe from home, lots of bed rest finally gave me the time to launch my personal website! I&#x27;ve been putting this off for a while, and travelling the globe was no help! But since getting sick in Jakarta, I decided to buckle down and finish it up!</p>
<p>Some of you have not seen me in a few months ‚Äì at the start of August, I packed my (enormous) bags and ventured off to Pakistan! After travelling the country for two whole months, I continued on to Singapore.</p>
<h2>Why am I here?</h2>
<p><del>I ask myself this question each morning in panic.</del>
You&#x27;re probably wondering what this website will be used for! This website gives me a place to post my writings, photographs, videos, and other fun things!</p>
<p>Lots more to come, but for now, check out my photo gallery to see pictures from my travels in Asia!</p>

<p>See you soon! üëã</p>]]></content:encoded>
