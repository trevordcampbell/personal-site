          <p>I enjoy solving seemingly impossible problems for fascinating people. I will work on almost any problem, in any field or subject, <Funderline text="explicitly without pay."></Funderline></p>
          <p>I'm trying to push the boundaries of my knowledge, experience, and capabilities to their limits. This keeps me sharp and always evolving. I have an excellent and multimodal track-record.</p>
